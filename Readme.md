# Calculator with GUI
## Python 3

A calculator with GUI (Graphical User Interface) made with Python 3.

## Functionalities

* All basic operations (+ | - | x | :)
* Clear button (C)

## Cretdits

This project has this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpeJKjWiOVk&t=699s) as base.
But I'd upgrated it to a better version.

## Upgrades

* The integers numbers are showed as integers, not as float, as it is in the original project.
* My project has a "Clear" button that resets the intire calculator - the original project hasn't.


## PS

* That project uses Tkinter Library.

* In Python3, Tkinter is come pre installed. Butt we can also install it by using the command:

    `pip install tkinter.`
