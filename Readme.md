# Calculator with GUI
## Python 3

A calculator with GUI (Graphical User Interface) made with Python 3.

### How to run this project

To Run this project, we have two options:

1) First
    * Download de main.py file and the folders "images" and "icons".
    * Run the main.py file (Visual Stuio Code recommended).
2) Second
    * Donwload the "executable" folder files (or just the calculator.rar on it).
    * Run the main.exe file.

## Functionalities

* All basic operations (+ | - | x | :)
* Clear button (C)

## Cretdits

* This project has this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpeJKjWiOVk&t=699s) as base.
But I'd upgrated it to a better version.

* To learn how to create a executable file, I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGSerUmK0CE&t=1s).

## Upgrades

* The integers numbers are showed as integers, not as float, as it is in the original project.
* My project has a "Clear" button that resets the intire calculator - the original project hasn't.


## PS

* That project uses Tkinter Library.

* In Python3, Tkinter is come pre installed. Butt we can also install it by using the command:

    `pip install tkinter`
